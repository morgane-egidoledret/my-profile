			<li>Having time with my family</li>
				<div class="List-Lighter">
				<p>My family lives in really differents places, I have family in Chile but also in Saint-Pierre et Miquelon which are really far places from Cergy so I can't see them really often. But I love having time with them for example going for a walk or eat together at restaurants.</p>

			<li>Travel</li>
				<div class="List-Lighter">
				<p>Because I have family in really far places, we travel a lot with my parents to go see the rest of the family. But we also travel in different countries such as Cuba or the United States. I love discovering new places, cultures and food so we try to travel the more we can.</p>
